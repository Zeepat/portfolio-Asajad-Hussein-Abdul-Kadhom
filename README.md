Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Asajad, and I am currently a student at ITHS studying AI and machinelearning with python.

In high-school I studied in a programme called International Baccalaureate (IB), where I studied mathematics, physics and English at higher-level and Swedish, chemistry and economics and standard-level.
