Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Asajad, and I am currently a student at ITHS studying AI and machinelearning with python. I am 22 years old and I have a passion for programming. I first started loving computers and everything to do with them at the age of 8 and I did my first ever programming in Javascript when I was 12. I didn't do much with programming after that just until a few years ago when I started to get into it further than before.

In high-school I studied in a programme called International Baccalaureate (IB), where I studied mathematics, physics and English at higher-level and Swedish, chemistry and economics at standard-level. 

Later I went on to take a gap-year and the year after I started studying a physics degree in Gothenburg's University for two years. After the second year I decided to drop out to pursue my dream in programming, hence where I am at now.
